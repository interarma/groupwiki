====== The 'projects' namespace ======
As its name suggests, this namespace is where all of the documented projects and how-tos should be kept.  (You can, of course, put them anywhere on this site, but if choose to do that, make sure you include the appropriate ''dataentry'' tags --- otherwise they won't show up on the 'Projects and How-tos' index page.)

Note, also, that you //can// create child namespaces under '':projects''; not only will such pages automatically include a suitable ''dataentry'' tag, this is actually a good idea as it allows articles relating to a more complex project to be grouped together in an intuitive way --- and if you want to compartmentalise things a bit, it's easier to restrict access by (child) namespaces than on a page-by-page basis.
