====== Documents and Reports Home Page ======
This page lists all of the books, reports, papers, manuals and websites that are described within the ''documents'' namespace.  To view or edit a page just click on its title.  To create a new page, enter its title in the box below, choose its type and status from the appropriate drop-down box, and click on the 'Add Page' button.  If a project remains //after// it's been deleted, go [[:documents:start?do=admin&page=data_clean|here]] and click on 'Clean database!'.

**Note:** where possible, try //not// to include any hyphens (''-'') in the title as they just tend to complicate things --- use underscores (''_'') instead and change them back in the title when you go to edit the page.
