====== The 'documents' namespace ======
As its name suggests, this namespace is where descriptions of documents of interest should be kept.  (You can, of course, put them anywhere on this site, but if choose to do that, make sure you include the appropriate ''dataentry'' tags --- otherwise they won't show up on the 'Documents and Reports' index page.)

Note, also, that you //can// create child namespaces under '':documents'', but it probably makes less sense to do that here than it does for the [[namespace:projects|:projects]] namespace.
