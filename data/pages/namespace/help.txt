====== The 'help' namespace ======
As its name suggests, this namespace is where the site-wide help files are kept.  (You can, of course, put them anywhere on this site, but if choose to do that, make sure you include the appropriate ''dataentry'' tags --- otherwise they won't show up on the 'Help' index page.)

Note, also, that you //can// create child namespaces under '':help'', but it probably makes less sense to do that here than it does for the [[namespace:projects|:projects]] namespace.
