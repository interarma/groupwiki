===== Example Contact Form =====
If you want anonymous visitors to be able to contact you, you might want to include a contact form on this page.  If you do, though, you really should create and enable a reCapture account for //your// site to reduce the amount of spam that you receive; instructions on how to do this is given [[http://wiki.echtzeitraum.de/applications/plugins/dokuwiki/contact#requirements|here]].
