====== The Speech of M T Cicero in Defence of Titus Annius Milo (M Tullius Cicero) ======
Congratulations, you've created a new page!  Note that if the document title
contains a hyphen, there will also be a ''-'' in the label between the 
''----dataentry----'' and '----' entries below --- you should change it to an 
underscore (''_''), otherwise this document won't be indexed correctly.

Oh, and you'll probably want to delete this and the preceding paragraphs before 
you get started --- be sure to the leave the ''MULTI_PLUGIN'' and ''dataentry''
lists intact, though.
