====== The 'meetings' namespace ======
As its name suggests, this namespace is where all of the meeting minutes should be kept.  (You can, of course, put them anywhere on this site, but if choose to do that, make sure you include the appropriate ''dataentry'' tags --- otherwise they won't show up on the 'Minutes of Meetings' index page.)

Note, also, that you //can// create child namespaces under '':meetings'', but it probably makes less sense to do that here than it does for the [[namespace:projects|:projects]] namespace.
